                                Fuel or oil smoke damage, also known as petroleum residue, occurs when petroleum-based products burn or heating appliances like oil-fired furnaces malfunction. A small leak or explosion can spread smoke and soot throughout the property.

                                Protein smoke damage results from cooking mishaps where organic matter evaporates during low-heat fires. This type of damage leaves behind burnt food odors that permeate the home, discoloring surfaces and leaving residue on walls and furniture.

                                Wet smoke damage stems from smoldering, low-heat fires, often involving plastics or rubber. This creates thick, black smoke and leaves a dense, sticky residue thatâ€™s tough to clean without professional equipment.

                                The goal of smoke damage restoration is to completely eliminate all evidence of smoke. Professional restorers work to bring a home or building back to its pre-damage condition, ensuring the space is safe and free of harmful residues.
